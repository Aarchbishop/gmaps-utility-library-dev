= Introduction =

This is the release process for pushing stuff out to the release library. Right now, only pamela.fox can do this. 

= Pushing out new versions of an existing library =
  * Verify that examples exist that test all the introduced changes since last release.
  * Test each of the files in gmaps-utility-library-dev.googlecode.com/library/examples to make sure they work as intended in IE, FF, Safari.
  * Do an svn update on local gmaps-utility-library-dev
{{{
svn update
}}}
  * Create new folder in gmaps-utility-library/library/ for the new release (e.g. 1.2) Export files from gmaps-utility-library-dev/library/ to gmaps-utility-library/library/NN
{{{
cd ~/www/gmaps-utility-library/labeledmarker/
mkdir 1.2
svn export ~/www/gmaps-utility-library-dev/labeledmarker/ 1.2/ --force
}}}
  * Run svn add on the new folder. Run svn propset on all files (for HTML/CSS)
{{{
svn add 1.2
find . -name '*.html' | xargs svn propset svn:mime-type text/html
find . -name '*.css' | xargs svn propset svn:mime-type text/css
find . -name '*.js' | xargs svn propset svn:mime-type text/javascript
find . -name '*.xml' | xargs svn propset svn:mime-type text/xml
find . -name '*.png' | xargs svn propset svn:mime-type image/png
find . -name '*.gif' | xargs svn propset svn:mime-type image/gif
}}}
  * Run a svn diff between the folder for the last version with the folder for the new version. Make sure you recognize all changes. (TODO: Showing 100% diff for some reason now).
{{{
svn diff ~/www/gmaps-utility-library-dev/labeledmarker/ .
//or, if that fails, diff the JS files
diff 1.1/labeledmarker.js 1.2/labeledmarker.js
}}}
  * Test each of the files in release/examples to make sure they work as intended in IE, FF, Safari.
