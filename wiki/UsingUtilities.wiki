#summary A wiki page with information on the utility scripts available to developers for generating documentation, packed versions, and setting mime-types.

In the util folder under trunk, there is an ant script (build.xml) that can be used for common tasks by developers of the library. Below is a description of the targets that can be specified:
  * all-pack: This will go through all the non-packed JS files, run jslint on them, and then run them through Dean Edwards' packer. You should fix JsLint errors if you expect your file to be packed correctly.
  * all-docs: This will go through all the non-packed JS files, and use JsDoc-toolkit to generate an HTML reference for them. Make sure that your top of the file has proper comments, otherwise you'll get a warning about "comment" and be unable to generate docs.
  * all-setalltypes: This will go through all the files and run "svn propset svn:mime-type MIME_TYPE_HERE" on each file that's either CSS, JS, XML, or HTML. This is done so that our docs and examples are rendered correctly when viewed in the repository.
  * all: This will do all of the above (warning:may take a while).
