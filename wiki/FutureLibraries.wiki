#summary Ideas for future libraries to add here

= Ideas =

  * !GeometryControl: !MyMaps-like control using the poly editing classes. Chris Marx is working on it, and it's nearly ready for release.
  * !SlideshowControl: Code is almost done, just need to put it in here.
  * !ProjectedOverlay: Code is done for this, it needs docs/example.
  * !OverviewMapControl: Gabriel is working on open-sourcing our internal code for this.
  * ZMarker: Esa has been working on this, we should get it in here.
  * !ExtPolyGraph: An abstraction for GPolyline- and GMarker-based [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29 graphs].  I did an undirected implementation for creating and editing [http://xkcd.com/85/ sidewalk] data.
  * !OpacityControl: See [http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/demogallery.html demo].
