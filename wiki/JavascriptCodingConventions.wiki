#summary Coding conventions to be followed in Javascript files here.

= Introduction =

All Javascript files must follow these coding conventions before they can be committed to the release project.


= Language Rules =
  
  * Variable declarations must start with 'var.'
  * All JS expressions must end with a semi-colon.
  * Method definitions should look like:
{{{
 Foo.prototype.bar = function() {
  /* ... */
};
}}}

= Style Rules =

== Naming ==
  * Capitalization: functionNamesLikeThis, variableNamesLikeThis, !ClassNamesLikeThis, and SYMBOLIC_CONSTANTS_LIKE_THIS. 
  * Be descriptive.
  * Private variables or functions should end in underscores (func_).
  * Optional function arguments start with !opt_.

== Formatting ==
  * No tabs anywhere - 2 spaces indent for each level of scope.
  * Wrapped lines should be indented 4 spaces.
  * Object initialization looks like:
{{{
  Obj = {
    key: "value",
    key2: "value2"
  };
}}}
  
== Comments ==
  * Should follow JSDoc convention: http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net/
  * Each function must be commented (purpose, @param, @return).
  * Inline comments useful if code is unclear.
  * Copyright, author, license, plus short description of file at top of code.
