<div>
  The weather outside is frightful<br />
  But the fire is so delightful<br />
  And since we’ve no place to go<br />
  Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow<br />
  Well, it doesn’t show signs of stopping<br />
  But we’ve got some corn for popping<br />
  And the lights are turned way down low<br />
  Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow<br />
